            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMongſt the innumerous bloody acts, and deſperate Deſigns which hath bin committed in this ſinfull Land, the like hath ſeldome been ſeen or heard of, which this enſuing Relation hath here to unfold, being a moſt ſad and much-lamented ſtory, of the late bloody murder committed at DOVER,
<pb facs="tcp:159942:3"/>within the County of Kent; which I ſhall briefly recite: But (by reaſon of diverſity of Opinions, which are now held and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by too many ſorts of people within this Kingdome) I ſhall deſire to ſpend ſome few lines of former Examples, by inſtancing ſome inhumane acts, much reflecting upon this dolefull ſtory, viz.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Reign of our Royall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, King Charles, there happened neere P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fract is Yorkſhire, a great and bloudy murder, upon a little Boy about foure yeares of age, committed by its own Parents.</p>
            <p>For neer the aforeſaid Town, there lived a man and his wife, who were of two ſeverall Religion, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ltitle ſon of ſome yeares of maturity, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (being a Proteſtant) deſired to have him put to Schoole, and to be brought up in the Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foſſion: but his wife denved the ſame, ſaying, ſhee would havee hrm brought no in the Catholike Faith, or elſe he ſhould be of no Religion at all, which (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) fell out ſo: For, this bloudy woman watching her opportunity, murdered the Boy; but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards apprehended, and ſuffered death for her bloody Fact.</p>
            <p>Divers other examples might be inſtanced, but I will no longer detract time, and therefore proceed to the enſuing ſtory, which we are now to treat upon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:159942:3"/>
            <p>At the ſamous town of Dover, within the county of Kent, it ſo fell out, that one Iohn Champian, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Tradeſmad, having mairyed a wife from Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham, and living ſome certain years at Dover, his place of habitation, it pleaſed God to ſend them tiſſue, and being delivered of a Child, after ſome few dayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, her husband deſired to have it Chriſtened (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the antient Cuſtome of the Kingdome) but ſhe would by no meanes condiſcend to it, which much perplexed her husband.</p>
            <p>But ſixe or ſeven weekes being paſt and gone, this wicked minded woman took her opportunity; and on a day when her husband was abroad, took a great knife and cut off the Childs head.</p>
            <p>And when her husband came in, ſhe called him into a little Parlour, where the poore Infant lay bleeding, uttering theſe words.</p>
            <p>Behold husband, thy ſweet Babe without a head. now go and baptize it, if you will, you muſt chriſten the head without a body: for here they lye ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>At the 2ight of which, her husband were aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſaying.</p>
            <p>O thou bloody and inhumane wretch, what haſte thou done.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, ſome of the Neighbors hearing him immediatly came in, and ſeeing this foul miſdeed, ſent for the Offieers of the Towne, where ſhee was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and forth with ſent to priſon, there to remaine untill the next Aſſize, where by juſtice ſhe muſt bee tryed according to the Lawes of this Realm. Many wofull expreſſions are heard to proceed from her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:159942:4"/>very penitent for her unhappy Crime, her Conſcience being much troubled, and her eyes ſad and diſtracted, by beholding ſuch ſtrange Viſions.</p>
            <p>For, ſhee can no wayes fixe her eyes upon any thing, but preſently (ſhe conceives) the poore Bubo to appear before her without a head.</p>
            <p>Thus may we ſee, that where diviſion and cootrover ſie doth ariſe, ſad effects will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly follow: for no ſooner can there a breach appea; but preſently Sathan is ready to ſtop it up, by infuſing his deluding ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into their hearts, for the increaſing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, diſcord, and contention, and when once it hath taken poſſeſſion, it is a hard matter to remove it, but ſtall lyeth open to the deluding ſnate of the Divel, being ready to Be entrapped upon any occaſion.</p>
            <p>And it is apparent, that when once the foot is in, the whole body will endeavor to creep in after; and where the leaſt clauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, there will immediatly ariſe a ſtrong argument, for the finall confuting of it; even ſo is it now, there being one breach laid open to the publique view; a great Crime I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe)
<pb facs="tcp:159942:4"/>yet not ſo great as to have a generaſſ Genſure, for one particular perſon; for, the beſt may do amiſſe, and the greateſt Profeſſor (ſometimes) that liveth, may commit high mildemeanours, contrary to his Profeſſion; for, is it not apparent, &amp; probable, that there is knaves of all trades.</p>
